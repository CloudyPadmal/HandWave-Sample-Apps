HandWave-Sample-Apps
====================
> A collection of Android apps using the HandWave library.


## Overview 
HandWave is a library that allows developers to enable touch-free interactions in their apps. 
HandWave uses the built-in, forward-facing camera on a device to recognize usersâ€™ in-air gestures. The API provides developers with easy access to a variety of touch-free gestures which invoke callback functions when detected. 

Code for HandWave can be found [here] (https://github.com/kritts/HandWave).
